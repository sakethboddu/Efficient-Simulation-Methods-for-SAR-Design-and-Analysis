# Efficient-Simulation-Methods-for-SAR-Design-and-Analysis

#fixed the signal parameters
#fixed co-ordinates
#uses three different types of input signals to analyze the output resoultion of image
#for every single input signal 
#calculating distance from the transmitted signal to the receiver which is fixed with corordinates
#and then that delay is added to the input signal
#for that signal we added filtering technique to decrease the noise
#then applied fft to obtain spectrum of received signal
#and then coverted into csv file to integrate with VSG
#then connverted into ARB file(binary file)
#then integrated with VSG through USB address
#then saved ARB file in VSG
#then opened that arb file in VSG that will be connected through RF cable to analyse the spectrum in CXA analyzer
#and for that received signal we developed SAR image using range imaging and cross range imaging including 2D FFT  
#comparision with three different types of signal outputs and provided a clonclusion which is better among the three
